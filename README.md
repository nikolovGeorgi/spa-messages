# React Practice

## Given these API endpoints:

  1. GET /messages
  2. GET /messages/{id}
  3. DELETE /messages/{id}
  4. POST /messages

### At this url, build an SPA that allows the viewer to:
  1. view a list of messages, displaying the message text and the date the message was posted
  2. view all details of a single message
  3. delete messages
  4. allow posting a new message

## Please DON'T use jQuery, and DO use React for the UI components.

## Don't spend any longer than 4 hours on the exercise
